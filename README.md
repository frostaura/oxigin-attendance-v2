### Database Relationships
- **ApplicationUser** → **JobOrders** (One-to-Many, as Client)
- **ApplicationUser** → **TimeEntries** (One-to-Many)
- **ApplicationUser** → **JobAssignments** (One-to-Many, as Employee)
- **ApplicationUser** → **Jobs** (One-to-Many, as CrewBoss)
- **ApplicationUser** → **LeaveRequests** (One-to-Many)
- **JobOrder** → **Quotes** (One-to-Many)
- **JobOrder** → **DailyCrewRequirements** (One-to-Many)

### Key Business Rules
- **Overtime Calculation**: Automatic overtime when daily hours exceed 8 hours
- **Single Active Session**: Users can only have one active TimeEntry at a time per job
- **Time Validation**: ClockOutTime must be after ClockInTime
- **Role Permissions**: Only Managers/Admins can modify other users' time entries
- **Job Assignment**: Employees can only be assigned to jobs by Crew Bosses or higher
- **Client Orders**: Only clients can create job orders in their portal
- **Quote Approval**: Only the ordering client can approve their quotes
- **Email Tracking**: All client communications are logged for audit purposes

**Start Frontend Development Server**:
```bash
npm start
```
✅ Frontend will be running at: `http://localhost:3000`

#### 5. Initial Login

The system creates default accounts for all roles on first run:

**Default Account Credentials**:
- **Administrator**: `admin@oxigin.com` / `Admin@123`
- **Manager**: `manager@oxigin.com` / `Manager@123`  
- **Crew Boss**: `crewboss@oxigin.com` / `CrewBoss@123`
- **Employee**: `employee@oxigin.com` / `Employee@123`
- **Client**: `client@example.com` / `Client@123`

⚠️ **Important**: Change all default passwords immediately in production!

#### 6. Email System Testing

After setup, test the email integration:

```bash
# Test email configuration (optional step)
curl -X POST https://localhost:7017/api/email/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"testEmail": "your-email@example.com"}'
```

**Email Setup Verification**:
1. Login as Manager (`manager@oxigin.com`)
2. Create a test job order
3. Generate and email a sample timesheet
4. Verify email delivery and formatting
5. Check email logs in the system for any issues

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### Backend Architecture
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with Controllers, Services, and Data layers
- **Repository Pattern**: Entity Framework provides repository-like functionality
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in .NET DI container for service registration
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless token-based authentication
- **API-First Design**: RESTful API with comprehensive documentation

#### Frontend Architecture  
- **Component-Based**: Modular React components with single responsibilities
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for predictable state management
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type checking
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic encapsulation
- **API Layer**: Centralized API communication with error handling

#### Data Flow
1. **Frontend Request**: User interacts with React components
2. **State Management**: Actions dispatched to Redux store
3. **API Service**: HTTP requests sent to backend API
4. **Controller**: API endpoints receive and validate requests
5. **Service Layer**: Business logic processing
6. **Data Access**: Entity Framework queries database
7. **Response**: Data flows back through the same layers

max_connections = 100
shared_buffers = 256MB
effective_cache_size = 1GB

# Performance settings
work_mem = 4MB

#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/oxigin-attendance"
DB_NAME="oxigin_attendance"

mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

pg_dump -h localhost -U oxigin_user -d $DB_NAME > $BACKUP_DIR/backup_$DATE.sql

# Keep only last 30 days of backups
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "backup_*.sql" -mtime +30 -delete
```

## 🔧 Development Notes

### Authentication Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as API
    participant D as Database
    
    U->>F: Login credentials
    F->>A: POST /api/auth/login
    A->>D: Validate user
    D-->>A: User data
    A-->>F: JWT token + user info
    F->>F: Store token in memory/localStorage
    
    Note over F,A: Subsequent requests
    F->>A: API request with Bearer token
    A->>A: Validate JWT token
    A-->>F: Protected resource data
```

### Time Tracking Logic
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User clicks Clock In] --> B{Already clocked in?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Show error message]
    B -->|No| D[Create TimeEntry with status=Active]
    D --> E[Start tracking time]
    
    F[User clicks Clock Out] --> G{Active entry exists?}
    G -->|No| H[Show error message] 
    G -->|Yes| I[Calculate total hours]
    I --> J{Hours > 8?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Calculate overtime]
    J -->|No| L[Set overtime to 0]
    K --> M[Update entry status=Completed]
    L --> M
    
    style D fill:#e1f5fe
    style M fill:#c8e6c9
```

### Business Rules Implementation

#### Overtime Calculation
```csharp
public TimeSpan CalculateOvertimeHours(TimeSpan totalHours, TimeSpan? breakTime = null)
{
    var standardWorkDay = TimeSpan.FromHours(8);
    var effectiveHours = totalHours - (breakTime ?? TimeSpan.Zero);
    
    return effectiveHours > standardWorkDay 
        ? effectiveHours - standardWorkDay 
        : TimeSpan.Zero;
}
```

#### Break Time Management
- **Automatic Tracking**: System can automatically calculate break time
- **Manual Entry**: Users can manually specify break duration
- **Validation**: Break time cannot exceed total work time
- **Business Rule**: Breaks are subtracted from total hours for overtime calculation

#### Time Entry Validation
```csharp
public class TimeEntryValidator
{
    public ValidationResult ValidateTimeEntry(TimeEntryCreateDto dto)
    {
        var errors = new List<string>();
        
        // Clock out must be after clock in
        if (dto.ClockOutTime.HasValue && dto.ClockOutTime <= dto.ClockInTime)
            errors.Add("Clock out time must be after clock in time");
            
        // Maximum 24 hours per entry  
        if (dto.ClockOutTime.HasValue)
        {
            var duration = dto.ClockOutTime.Value - dto.ClockInTime;
            if (duration > TimeSpan.FromHours(24))
                errors.Add("Time entry cannot exceed 24 hours");
        }
        
        // Break time validation
        if (dto.BreakTime.HasValue && dto.ClockOutTime.HasValue)
        {
            var totalTime = dto.ClockOutTime.Value - dto.ClockInTime;
            if (dto.BreakTime > totalTime)
                errors.Add("Break time cannot exceed total work time");
        }
        
        return new ValidationResult { IsValid = !errors.Any(), Errors = errors };
    }
}
```

### Role-Based Access Implementation
```csharp
// Attribute-based authorization
[HttpGet("report/all")]
[Authorize(Roles = "Manager,Administrator")]
public async Task<ActionResult<List<TimeReportDto>>> GetAllEmployeesTimeReport()
{
    // Implementation
}

// Policy-based authorization (future enhancement)
public class TimeEntryAuthorizationHandler : AuthorizationHandler<TimeEntryRequirement>
{
    protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(
        AuthorizationHandlerContext context,
        TimeEntryRequirement requirement)
    {
        // Custom authorization logic
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

**Issue**: Database connection fails
```
Error: Unable to connect to PostgreSQL server
```
**Solutions**:
1. Verify PostgreSQL service is running:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   net start postgresql-x64-13
   
   # macOS
   brew services start postgresql
   
   # Linux
   sudo systemctl start postgresql
   ```
2. Check connection string in `appsettings.json`
3. Verify database and user exist:
   ```sql
   \l                          -- List databases
   \du                         -- List users
   ```
4. Test connection manually:
   ```bash
   psql -h localhost -U oxigin_user -d oxigin_attendance
   ```

**Issue**: JWT token validation fails
```
Error: 401 Unauthorized - Invalid token
```
**Solutions**:
1. Check JWT configuration in `appsettings.json`
2. Ensure JWT key is at least 32 characters
3. Verify token hasn't expired
4. Check frontend is sending token in Authorization header:
   ```javascript
   headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
   ```

**Issue**: Entity Framework migration errors
```
Error: A migration with the name 'InitialCreate' already exists
```
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Remove existing migration
dotnet ef migrations remove

# Clear database and start fresh (development only)
dotnet ef database drop
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

#### Frontend Issues

**Issue**: API requests failing with CORS errors
```
Error: CORS policy blocked the request
```
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure backend CORS is configured in `Program.cs`:
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
   {
       options.AddPolicy("AllowFrontend", policy =>
       {
           policy.WithOrigins("http://localhost:3000")
                 .AllowAnyHeader()
                 .AllowAnyMethod();
       });
   });
   ```

**Issue**: Environment variables not loading
```
Error: REACT_APP_API_URL is undefined
```
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure `.env` file is in frontend root directory
2. Restart development server after changing `.env`
3. Variables must start with `REACT_APP_`
4. Check for typos in variable names

**Issue**: Build fails with TypeScript errors
```
Error: Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'
```
**Solutions**:
1. Add proper type guards:
   ```typescript
   const apiUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL;
   if (!apiUrl) throw new Error('API URL not configured');
   ```
2. Use optional chaining: `user?.firstName`
3. Provide default values: `user.firstName || 'Unknown'`

#### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Slow API responses
**Solutions**:
1. Check database query performance:
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM "TimeEntries" WHERE "UserId" = 'user-id';
   ```
2. Add database indexes:
   ```csharp
   modelBuilder.Entity<TimeEntry>()
       .HasIndex(t => t.UserId);
   ```
3. Implement pagination for large datasets
4. Use projection to select only needed fields

**Issue**: Frontend performance degradation
**Solutions**:
1. Use React.memo for component optimization
2. Implement proper key props in lists
3. Use lazy loading for routes:
   ```typescript
   const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./Dashboard'));
   ```
4. Profile with React Developer Tools

### Debug Configuration

#### Backend Debugging (VS Code)
```json
// .vscode/launch.json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",

        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      },
      "sourceFileMap": {
        "/Views": "${workspaceFolder}/Views"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Frontend Debugging
1. Install React Developer Tools browser extension
2. Use Redux DevTools extension
3. Enable source maps in development
4. Use browser debugger with breakpoints

### Logging Configuration

#### Backend Logging
```csharp
// Program.cs
builder.Logging.ClearProviders();
builder.Logging.AddConsole();
builder.Logging.AddDebug();

// In production, consider Serilog
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.Console()
    .WriteTo.File("logs/app.log", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)
    .CreateLogger();
```

#### Frontend Logging
```typescript
// utils/logger.ts
export const logger = {
  info: (message: string, data?: any) => {
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
      console.log(`[INFO] ${message}`, data);
    }
  },
  error: (message: string, error?: any) => {
    console.error(`[ERROR] ${message}`, error);
    // In production, send to error tracking service
  }
};
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Create indexes for better query performance
CREATE INDEX idx_timeentry_userid ON "TimeEntries"("UserId");
CREATE INDEX idx_timeentry_clockin ON "TimeEntries"("ClockInTime");
CREATE INDEX idx_timeentry_status ON "TimeEntries"("Status");
CREATE INDEX idx_user_employeeid ON "AspNetUsers"("EmployeeId");
```

#### API Optimization
```csharp
// Response caching
[HttpGet]
[ResponseCache(Duration = 300)] // Cache for 5 minutes
public async Task<ActionResult<List<TimeReportDto>>> GetTimeReport()
{
    // Implementation
}

// Compression
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddResponseCompression();
    services.Configure<GzipCompressionProviderOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.Level = CompressionLevel.Optimal;
    });
}
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
```csharp
// Program.cs
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
    .AddNpgSql(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"))
    .AddCheck("api", () => HealthCheckResult.Healthy());

app.MapHealthChecks("/health", new HealthCheckOptions
{
    ResponseWriter = UIResponseWriter.WriteHealthCheckUIResponse
});
```

### Logging Strategy
```csharp
// Structured logging with Serilog
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
        .ReadFrom.Configuration(configuration)
        .Enrich.FromLogContext()
        .WriteTo.Console()
        .WriteTo.File("logs/app-.log", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)
        .CreateLogger();
    
    try
    {
        Log.Information("Starting up");
        CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Log.Fatal(ex, "Application start-up failed");
    }
    finally
    {
        Log.CloseAndFlush();
    }
}
```

### Backup and Recovery
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily backup script
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/oxigin-attendance"
DB_NAME="oxigin_attendance"
